# 🛡️ UPI Fraud Detection System

An end-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline** designed to detect **fraudulent UPI transactions** using **real-time data**.  
This project integrates data processing, model training, backend automation, and a user-friendly frontend dashboard — all working together to identify and alert suspicious activities.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **`model/`** – Contains all machine learning algorithms, model training scripts, and evaluation notebooks used for fraud detection.
- **`pipeline/`** – Handles data ingestion, preprocessing, and automated email alerts triggered when suspicious transactions are detected.
- **`client/`** – Frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a real-time dashboard for monitoring transactions and fraud alerts.
- **`api_server/`** – Backend API server built with FastAPI. It is hosted separately to ensure better modularity, scalability, and security.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-time fraud alerts** – Instant notifications on suspicious transactions  
✅ **Decision Tree-based detection** – Simple and explainable ML model  
✅ **Automated SQL workflows** – Python scripts to fetch and process transaction data  
✅ **Frontend monitoring dashboard** – Clean UI for real-time insights
